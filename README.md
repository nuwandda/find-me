# Find Me

## A graduate project

In this project, we will aim at constructing a 2D map of our Computer Engineering department. With the help of the mapping of the department, we can help to a user where he or she wants to go.

In order to make a person able to navigate through its environment, one requires a
surrounding map and the personâ€™s location. We will create maps with the photos of the department with a camera via connections of the rooms.

After constructing the rooms, we can label each room and tell the user the route he or she should take. We can evaluate the performance by localization accuracy, execution time and response speed. An expected output of the project is shown in the figure on the right.
