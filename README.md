# Find Me

## A graduate project

In this project, we will aim at constructing a 2D map of our Computer Engineering department. With the help of the mapping of the department, we can help to a user where he or she wants to go.

In order to make a person able to navigate through its environment, one requires a
surrounding map and the personâ€™s location. We will create maps with the photos of the department with a camera via connections of the rooms. Those photos have QR codes to detect each room.

After constructing the rooms, we can create adjaceny graph from the information we got from QR codes. Then, one can easily visit rooms.
